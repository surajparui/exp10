# 3D Boxes Background - Readme

This project is a demonstration of creating a 3D boxes background using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It can be used as a practical session for the Cloud Computing subject to showcase the implementation of a web-based application.

## Project Overview

The project consists of the following files:

- **index.html**: This file serves as the main HTML document for the web page. It contains the structure and layout of the page, including the canvas element where the 3D boxes background is rendered.

- **script.js**: This file contains the JavaScript code responsible for creating and animating the 3D boxes background. It utilizes WebGL and the Three.js library to generate the 3D scene, create boxes, and handle the animation.

- **style.css**: This file contains the CSS styles to customize the appearance of the web page. It includes basic styling for the canvas element and any additional elements on the page.

## Hosting the Project Online

To host the project online, follow these steps:

1. Create an account on a cloud computing platform or web hosting service of your choice. Some popular options include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, or Netlify.

2. Set up a new project or instance on the chosen cloud platform. Refer to the documentation or tutorials provided by the platform for detailed instructions on how to create and configure a web hosting environment.

3. Upload the project files (`index.html`, `script.js`, `minions` directory, and `style.css`) to the cloud hosting environment. You can use the provided web-based interface or command-line tools for file upload.

4. Ensure that the necessary dependencies, such as WebGL and Three.js, are supported by the hosting environment. If required, install or enable any additional components or plugins.

5. Once the files are uploaded and the environment is configured, access the deployed web page using the provided URL or domain. The 3D boxes background should be visible and animated on the hosted web page.

## Additional Customization

Feel free to customize the project according to your preferences or specific requirements. Some possible modifications include:

- Changing the colors, shapes, or textures of the 3D boxes.
- Adding additional 3D objects or elements to the scene.
- Modifying the animation speed, rotation, or behavior of the boxes.
- Enhancing the web page layout or design by updating the HTML structure and CSS styles.

Remember to test the modifications locally before deploying them to the hosting environment to ensure the desired results.

## Credits

The 3D boxes background project is developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, WebGL, and the Three.js library. It draws inspiration from various web-based 3D graphics and animation examples available online. The project is intended for educational and demonstration purposes.
